ROS.jl
======

ROS.jl is a wrapper of RosPy for Julia.

Thanks to PyCall, this package is only a very thin wrapper over the Python implementation.
In fact, RosPy modules can be imported and nodes created without even using this module.
This module will attempt to handle syntactic and technical issues of running ROS nodes from Julia.

More to come!
